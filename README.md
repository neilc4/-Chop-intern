Hi, I'm Neil

Thanks for stopping by.  
I’m a student interested in computer science, data processing, and automation.  
Here are some projects I built during my internship at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).

Projects

- **bam.py**  
  A tool for working with BAM files, mainly focused on reading and handling genomic sequencing data in a simpler way.

- **manifest.py**  
  Generates and manages manifests to help keep track of samples and keep workflows organized.

- **manifestname.py**  
  Cleans up and standardizes manifest names so everything follows the same rules.

- **manifestnum.py**  
  Makes sure manifest entries are numbered and ordered consistently.

- **output.py**  
  Organizes raw pipeline output into cleaner, easier-to-read results.

- **task.py**  
  Automates the setup of pipeline jobs by pulling together inputs and parameters into ready-to-run tasks.

About These Projects

These scripts were designed to make bioinformatics workflows at CHOP smoother and less repetitive.  
They helped with things like tracking samples, managing files, and automating routine steps.  
Working on them gave me the chance to solve real-world problems while learning how research teams handle large amounts of data.
